1. Its asynchronous nature can make the code hard to visualize, the loose typing can make debugging difficult, and the web platform it runs on prioritizes client side security rather than server side.
2. Javascript developers made the language loosely typed so that the type of a variable is not a concern. They added asynchrounous features so that processes could run simultaneously.
3. A compiled language needs to be compiled, meaning converted into machine code/assembly language before running, while an interpreted language is executed as is. Javascript is an interpreted language. The upside is that Javascript syntax is easier to pick up, while the downside is that it takes longer to execute.
4. The professor is focusing on vanilla Javascript so that the students understand the abstractness of it. With vanilla JS, students will not have to rely on a particular framework and are more versatile. The drawback to learning a framework first is that it would be harder to adapt to other frameworks or even vanilla JS.
5. This lab relates to the project because it teaches the basics of Javascript, how to debug in devtools, and how to create a framework. All of these would be useful in the planning and implementation of the class's project and beyond.
